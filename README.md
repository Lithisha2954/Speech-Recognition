# Speech-Recognition
This project builds a speech recognition system using the Mini Speech Commands dataset. Audio data is converted to spectrograms and fed into a CNN for classification. The model detects voice commands like “yes” or “stop” and is tested on real audio inputs after converting and preprocessing them
